          I know I made mistakes. I let my insecurities speak louder than my love. I created stress when you deserved peace. You were patient. You stayed. And I didn’t always meet you where you were.

          I also regret the chances I didn’t take. The days I could’ve tried harder to meet you — physically, emotionally — but didn’t. I thought we had time. I thought later would come sooner.

          If I could go back, I’d show up. Sooner. Softer. Braver. But since I can’t, all I can do is be better — now.
