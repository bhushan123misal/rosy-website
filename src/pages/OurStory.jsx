          We met for just 10 minutes at TechFest. That was it — just a hello, a laugh, and a spark. But something about you lingered. You became a message, a friend, and slowly, something I couldn't imagine my days without.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          We stayed friends for two years. Through long texts, silly chats, late-night calls, and silent gaps… you were still there. Then one day — not the best day — we found ourselves in a relationship. It wasn’t perfect. But it was real.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          And here we are. 3.5 years of long distance. Without meeting again. Still choosing each other through time zones, overthinking, missed chances, and growing pains. That takes something more than just love — it takes belief.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg italic text-center mt-10">
          This isn’t a fairytale.<br />
          It’s something better.<br />
          It’s ours.
